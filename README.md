## Bobabuddy
Phase 2 notes:

 - The REST server is now hosted on an Azure Cloud virtual machine at `http://20.124.182.63:8080`.
 - By Default, the android application will access this remote server to fetch resources. If you wish to change this behaviour, edit the url constant at `BobaBuddyUI/lib/utils/constant.dart`.
 - If you are running the server on your local machine, use the android loopback address `http://10.0.2.2 :8080`.
### How To run
- Clone the repo
- Let gradle set up the project dependencies
- Note that this project requires Java 11 and higher.
- run BobabuddyApplication in src/main/java
- Spring boot will initialize an embedded tomcat web server on localhost, which you can access with curl through
  url: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/<api-endpoints>`
- If you wish to interface with this backend server directly, you can do so via the http clients built into intellij. Note that A firebase idToken in header `X-Authentication-Firebase` need to be passed to the server for the request to be authenticated. Without completely breaching security by leaking the firebase project private key, this key can only be generated by the android app with email/password login.
- The database has a default admin user `bob@gmail.com` with password `mas123`. You can use this credential to login from the android app.

For all available api methods, see `http://20.124.182.63:8080/swagger-ui.html` or `http://127.0.0.1:8080/swagger-ui.html`
when the program is running on the same machine.

## BobaBuddy UI

The frontend android client of the application. We chose to write the UI in dart using the flutter sdk to give us complete control of design and 
functionality. For a full walkthrough of functionality, there is a playlist here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLECF-cwue5-sygEJ1i_h4csWJfxgqw_er 

Currently, the UI reflects the core functionality of our application, however, moving forward we would like to have our UI utilize all features in our backend
such as finding drinks by category.

We designed this UI with the simple and intuitive use principle in mind by keeping the layout familiar, clutter-free, and easily navigable. 

### How to run
 - the prebuilt apk is available at `BobaBuddyUI/build/app/outputs/apk/debug`. 
 - It is recommended to run this app on a Pixel 4 emulator, as this is our development environment.
 - If you wish to build from source, the following are required:
   - Flutter 
   - Android studio 
 - Once you setup Flutter and android sdk in android studio, you may connect to an emulator and build the app from source.
